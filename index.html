    <i>Mankind will migrate into space, and will cross the airless Saharas which separate planet from planet and sun from sun.</i>
    <br>—Winwood Reade, The Martyrdom of Man (1872)

      Humans have always been explorers. When ancient humans stumbled across unknown lands or seas, they were compelled to explore them. They were driven by a desire to conquer new frontiers and by a thirst for knowledge, wealth, and prestige. These are the same motivations that drove people of the twentieth century to venture into space.

      Space begins at the edge of Earth’s atmosphere, just beyond the protective blanket of air and heat that surrounds the planet. This blanket is thick and dense near the surface and light farther away from the planet. About 100 kilometres above Earth the atmosphere becomes quite thin. This altitude is considered the first edge of outer space.

      While space exploration sounds adventurous, space holds many dangers to humans. Space is an inhospitable environment, devoid of air, food, or water. Everywhere it is either too hot or too cold for human life. Potentially harmful radiation flows in the form of cosmic rays from deep space and electromagnetic waves that emanate from the Sun and other stars. Tiny bits of rock and ice hurtle around in space at high velocities, like miniature missiles.

      . Getting into space is not easy, and getting back to Earth safely is even tougher. Returning to Earth from space requires conquering another mighty force: friction. Any object penetrating Earth’s atmosphere from space encounters layers and layers of dense air molecules. Travelling at high speed and rubbing against these molecules produces a fiery blaze that can rip apart most objects

      After reaching moon, people are now dreaming of longer journeys in space because most of space is still an unknown sea, just waiting to be explored.
