      Extraterrestrial life, also called alien life, is life that occurs outside of Earth. These  may range from simple bacteria to intelligent beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology.

      Since the mid-20th century, there has been an ongoing search for signs of extraterrestrial life. This encompasses a search for current and historic extraterrestrial life. Search methods range from analysis of telescope to radios used to detect and send communication signals.

      The concept of extraterrestrial life has had a major impact in works of science fiction. Over the years, science fiction communicated scientific ideas, imagined a wide range of possibilities, and influenced public interest in and perspectives of extraterrestrial life.

      In 1977, Voyager 1 and 2 were launched. Their primary mission was to visit Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 continued onto Uranus and Neptune; Voyager 1 has now made its way into interstellar space to search for aliens. Both craft carry a record on board, which will act like a time-capsule of Earth. It has greetings from Earth as well as different kinds of music. It also has noises of rocket engines, the sea, people talking, animalâ€™s sounds and lots of images. All of which sum up the Earth.

      In the vast space of space, it is difficult to assume that there is no life on another planet. When we Earthlings finally meet alien life, will we learn from each other or will we fight each other based on the theory of survival of the fittest? Only time will tell.
